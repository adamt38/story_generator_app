Flask & Requests

This is a short project to get me used to Flask and Requests. This is a simple web application that will let me generate a story with user-defined parameters. 

app.py takes care of al the backend functinos, story_generator.html will interact with caller.py, which takes care of making external requests to all of the other websites.
